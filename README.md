# Systematic Event-Driven Backtester

## Overview
This repository contains an event-driven, systematic backtester designed to simulate and analyze trading strategies with historical data. Unlike traditional backtesting models that loop over time series data, this backtester operates on an event-driven system, closely mimicking real-world trading environments by reacting to market, signal, and order events.

## Features
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Simulates live trading environments by processing events including market data, signal generation, order execution, and portfolio rebalancing.
- **Strategy Implementation Framework**: Easily implement and test custom trading strategies.
- **Risk Management Module**: Incorporates risk management rules to simulate realistic trading constraints and objectives.
- **Performance Analytics**: Generates a comprehensive set of performance metrics and visuals for analyzed strategies.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Creating a README for a GitHub repository is a great way to introduce and explain your project to potential users and contributors. Below is a template for an event-driven, systematic backtester. You can adjust the sections according to the specifics of your project.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/systematic-event-driven-backtester.git
cd systematic-event-driven-backtester
# install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quick Start
To get started with a basic strategy backtest:

```python
from backtester import Backtester
from strategy import YourStrategy

# Initialize your strategy
strategy = YourStrategy()

# Initialize the backtester with historical data path and your strategy
backtester = Backtester('path/to/your/historical/data.csv', strategy)

# Run the backtest
backtester.run()

# Analyze the results
backtester.results()
```
